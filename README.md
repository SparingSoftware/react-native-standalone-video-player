# react-native-standalone-video-player

React Native video player which can be re-used across views 
> **Still under development** (no official release yet).

---

In 90% of cases [react-native-video](https://github.com/react-native-video/react-native-video) will be enough. However there may be some cases when you need the Player to be separated from the View:
  - Loading video before presenting it
  - Showing the same video in different parts of the app (like preview and then fullview)
  - As list element

## Other

### Multiple instances
You can have multiple simultaneus players with different URIs. Each function/hook and PlayerVideoView have `playerInstance` prop or param.

```jsx
const { load } = useVideoPlayer(0);
const { load: loadOther } = useVideoPlayer(1);

// ...

<PlayerVideoView
  playerInstance={0}
/>

// ...

<PlayerVideoView
  playerInstance={1}
/>
```

### ExoPlayer / AVPlayer
On the native side on iOS it uses AVPlayer and on Android - ExoPlayer.

### isBoundToPlayer vs optional rendering
You can use `isBoundToPlayer` as option to enable/disable streaming to this view. You can also use traditional optional rendering instead:
```
{ isActive && <PlayerVideoView ... }
```
Using `isBoundToPlayer` is better because it does not require rerenders however it may lead to strange behaviour especially on Android. I am still not sure which option to use...
