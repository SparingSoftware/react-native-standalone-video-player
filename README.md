# react-native-standalone-video-player

React Native video player which can be re-used across views 

In 95% of cases https://github.com/react-native-video/react-native-video will be enough but if you need player which is separated from view - use this one.



## Installation

```sh
npm install https://github.com/SparingSoftware/react-native-standalone-video-player
```

## Usage

```js
import {
  useVideoPlayer,
  PlayerVideoView,
} from 'react-native-standalone-video-player';
// ...

const { load, play, pause } = useVideoPlayer(0);

useEffect(() => {
  load('VIDEO_URL');
}, []);

//...
<PlayerVideoView
  style={styles.player}
  isBoundToPlayer={true}
  playerInstance={0}
/>
//...


```

## TODO
1) Docs
2) Example (2 views) with giff
3) Example (FlatList) with giff
4) Android multiviews (SurfaceView?)
5) isBoundToPlayer vs rerender
6) tag version
